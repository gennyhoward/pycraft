Minecraft in Python with extended keys

This is a fork of [foglemans](https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft) [Minecraft in 500 lines of Python with Pyglet](https://www.slideshare.net/rdonkin/pyglet-and-minecraft-v1-1)

It adds these hotkeys:
* **L** to load in the MyCode.py file and run it.
* **C** to clear the canvas.
* **M** to make hills
